//
//  AppCoordinator.swift
//  PoimiApp — the adaptive navigation spine (issue #30, D20; architecture §6/§11).
//
//  A `@MainActor @Observable` coordinator owning the typed `Route` path and the authorization
//  state that gates the root phase (onboarding/recovery vs the albums library). The UI binds to
//  it; auth status drives `rootPhase`. One logical path expressed in two containers (compact
//  `NavigationStack`, regular `NavigationSplitView` detail stack) — see `AppRootView`.
//
//  It reads only the `PhotoLibraryProviding` seam (Phase 1), never PhotoKit directly, so it is
//  fully testable against `FakePhotoLibrary` with any seeded authorization.
